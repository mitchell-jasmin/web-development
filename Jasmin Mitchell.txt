                                          My name is Jasmin Mitchell and I am a freshman at Brenau University. I will be working towards a degree in Business Administration. I am currently 17, and will be 18 on August 27. I enjoy reading and writing for my hobbies, as well as looking aftrer my dogs.

                                          My GitHub username was actually made when I was attending a summer class on AI and we had to create a name based off a preexisting format. Most of our work stayed in that formating, so there isn't any specail reason behind why it is made a certain way. I don't really remember much from that class as I did not do very well in the coarse and struggled with most of what we were learning.
